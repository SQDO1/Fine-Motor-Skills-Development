Background

Developing and Improving fine-motor skills requires the individual to perform repetitive exercises or movements to activate neuroplasticity (how your brain wires itself while learning new skills) and master these skills. 

Two particular populations deal with the need of activating this neuroplasticity to (re-)develop or improve their fine-motors skills: toddlers, who are in the process of learning handwriting and patients recovering from a stroke, who need to regain those fine-motors skills for their daily activities.

Both educational and health centers normally work with the kids and patients providing them with exercises; however, the in-person time with them is limited. Thus, it is very common that kids and patients are given exercises to perform at home. The two biggest challenges of these in-home exercises are providing proper feedback and maintain the individual engagement on the activity. Kids and patients are, most of the time, by themselves or even when they have someone assisting them with the exercises this companion might not have the needed experience to provide accurate feedback; also, since these exercises repetitive, it is very easy that the individual lose the interest in them. 

In an effort to support these in-home activities, particularly improving the feedback process and maintaining high engagement, it is suggested to implement some of these activities using technology, such as low-cost easy-access game-based computer applications. Through these applications, it is possible to induce and maintain engagement and provided proper feedback to the user (either a kid or an adult patient).  


Description of the project

In this project, you will work on the implementation of a web-based application to support individuals on their effort to develop or improve their fine-motor skills. This application could have a high impact on toddlers dealing with the development of fine-motor skills needed to learn handwriting as well on patients recovering from a stroke to recover their fine-motors skills needed for their daily activities. 

This application should include at least three different exercises for the user to “play” with them. Each exercise should provide proper feedback to the user, this feedback could use both visual and audio components.
